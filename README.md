# Cytron_BlueBee4.0_AT_Library

This library provides users API to communicate with BlueBee 4.0 with Arduino.

List of APIs:

1. <strong>HM12(uint8_t rx_pin, uint8_t tx_pin) </strong></br>Users can set appropriate RX and TX pins from Arduino to start UART communication with BlueBee 4.0.

  E.g.<strong> HM12 BlueBee(2,3) </strong>
  - pin 2 from arduino act as RX connecting to TX of BlueBee 4.0
  - pin 3 from arduino act as TX connecting to RX of BlueBee 4.0
  
2.
